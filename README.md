A (hopefully) comprehensive guide to get you started on modding Hogwarts Legacy.

## Getting Started
In order to get started modding the game you'll need a few tools which will be linked:

Unreal Engine 4.27.2: as of the time of writing, this can be found in the [Epic Games Launcher](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/download)

Simply click "+" next to engine version and find 4.27.2

[Blender 2.83](https://download.blender.org/release/) For Mesh Swaps *I am unsure if newer versions of blender work with the addons needed*
